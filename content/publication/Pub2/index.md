abstract: |
  A combined experimental and numerical investigation was conducted to examine the mechanisms of aerodynamic noise reduction for twisted hexagonal cylinders at Reynolds numbers (Re = 2 × 10^4–10^5) and twist angles per unit span γ* ∈ [0, 1/3]. It reveals a non-monotonic dependence of noise reduction on γ*, optimised for γ* = 1/6, where a tonal noise reduction of 15 dB and a total sound reduction of 11 dB at Re = 2 × 10^4 were achieved. This was consistent across all Reynolds numbers tested.

  Additionally, dual tones were observed in the noise spectra for cases with 1/18 ≤ γ* < 1/6, leading to the identification of two distinct flow patterns (Pattern I and II) based on the number of tones in the spectrum. Large-eddy simulations were performed at Re = 2 × 10^4 to support the acoustic measurements. Spanwise variations in flow separation gave rise to two distinct regimes: separation (RI) and reattachment (RII).

  Pattern I (1/5.4 ≤ γ* ≤ 1/3): The spanwise variation of shear layer separation induced wavy vortex shedding, contributing to a moderate noise reduction.  

  Pattern II (1/18 ≤ γ* ≤ 1/7.2): Differences in vortex shedding frequencies between RI and RII regimes led to vortex dislocation, forming C- or X-type vortex structures.  

  The γ* = 1/6 configuration leads to a transitional pattern between Pattern I and II, where modulation was predominantly observed in the RI regime. The superior noise reduction of γ* = 1/6 stems from the combined effects of frequent vortex dislocation and modulation, which reduces spanwise coherency and increases wake three-dimensionality.
